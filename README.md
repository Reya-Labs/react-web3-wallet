## Branching model

In the UI world you should branch off `main` when building a feature.
So just go on `main`, pull latest and then branch out of it.
Create your PR against `main`.

Branch naming is quite standard, we tried to duplicate what we have done for
the committing messages, following standard commit message format: [https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/].

Branch names can start with the prefixes found in the regex under '.husky/pre-commit'.

### Short summary:

**DEVELOPING**
* create a branch from `main`, follow the naming convention for a branch
* wait for approval, resolve comments and make sure you have a green build
* merge to `main` using **Rebase and merge**

## Cloudflare

`brokoli-ui` uses Cloudflare to automate the process around creating builds that can be shared with the stakeholders.
What this means is that any push to a branch will create an environment for the team to test against!

These are sites hosted on Cloudflare and the build from main can be found at [brokoli.voltz.xyz](brokoli.voltz.xyz).

### Rules

**Environment branches (main)**
* merges to branch `main` always deploy to [brokoli.voltz.xyz](brokoli.voltz.xyz) with ENV variables specific for `main`

**Candidate branches:**
* commits on branches that follow the pattern `feat/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*`, `refactor/*` and `test/*`
